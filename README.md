## React-Based Application Development
**ToDoApp (LH React)**
This React project emphasizes component reusability and state management using React Hooks like useState and useReducer. The codebase integrates CRUD operations with localStorage for persistence, requiring knowledge of lifecycle methods and side-effect management via useEffect. The UI employs modular CSS-in-JS patterns, reflecting expertise in styling scalable applications.

**LSYCheck (Custom React Utility)**
A custom validation library built with TypeScript and React Context API, this project showcases advanced type definitions and generic components. The implementation of debounced input handling and dynamic form error reporting highlights mastery of performance optimization and user experience design. Unit tests using Jest validate core logic, demonstrating test-driven development (TDD) practices.

**MaxTrader (Financial Dashboard)**
MaxTrader combines real-time data visualization (via WebSocket integration) with complex state synchronization using Redux Toolkit. The responsive layout uses CSS Grid for adaptive dashboards, while Chart.js renders interactive financial graphs. Authentication flows with JWT tokens and axios interceptors illustrate secure API communication strategies.

## Advanced CSS Architecture
**Trillo (Hotel Booking Interface)**
Built with pure CSS Flexbox, Trillo emphasizes responsive design without media queries. The BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) methodology organizes stylesheets, and SASS mixins automate vendor prefixing. Animations for hover states and modal transitions reveal deep understanding of CSS performance bottlenecks.

**Nexter (Real Estate Platform)**
Nexter leverages CSS Grid for complex masonry layouts, using grid-template-areas for semantic HTML structure. Art-directed responsive images with <picture> tags optimize bandwidth usage across devices. The project employs CSS custom properties for theme consistency and clip-path for decorative shapes.

**Natours (Tour Booking Service)**
Natours implements advanced CSS animations like parallax scrolling and gradient transitions. The codebase uses 7-1 SASS architecture for scalable styling and PostCSS for auto-prefixing. Modern techniques like @supports queries ensure graceful degradation in older browsers.

## Full-Stack Integration & Tooling
**wbARM (Advanced React Masters)**
This Wes Bos-inspired project demonstrates full-stack React with custom Express APIs and MongoDB integration. Features include file uploads with Multer, OAuth via Google Cloud, and server-side rendering with Next.js. The Webpack configuration reveals expertise in code splitting and bundle optimization.

**OneHandBadass (Accessibility-Focused App)**
A keyboard-navigable interface built with React Accessibility (ARIA) standards. The project uses Canvas API for custom gesture visualizations and Web Workers to offload computation-heavy tasks. Axe-core audits ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance.

## Build Systems & Modern Workflows
**Trillo (Revisited)**
This iteration introduces Webpack 5 with hot module replacement (HMR) and tree-shaking. Babel plugins enable optional chaining and nullish coalescing for modern JavaScript. The Dockerized development environment showcases DevOps awareness.

**Nexter (Optimized Build)**
The production setup uses Critical CSS extraction and PurgeCSS to reduce render-blocking resources. Integration with Lighthouse CI enforces performance budgets, while Husky pre-commit hooks run ESLint and Prettier.

## Conclusion
These projects collectively validate expertise in:

-React ecosystems (Hooks, Context, Redux) \n
-CSS architecture (BEM, Grid, SASS) \n
-Build optimization (Webpack, Tree-shaking) \n
-Full-stack practices (API integration, SSR) \n
-Accessibility & performance (ARIA, Lighthouse) \n
